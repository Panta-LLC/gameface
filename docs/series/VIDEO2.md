# Script: Video 2: Deep Dive into Technical Design

- **Content**: Detailed exploration of the Technical Design phase of the GameFace project.
- **Script**:

  1. Recap the introduction from Video 1 and transition into the first phase: Technical Design.
  2. Explain the importance of Technical Design in the project lifecycle.
     Technical Design is crucial because it lays the foundation for the entire development process. It ensures that all team members have a clear understanding of the system's architecture, data flow, and component interactions. This clarity helps prevent costly rework and ensures that the final product meets user needs and expectations.
  3. Discuss the key components of Technical Design:

     - System Architecture
       System Architecture is the backbone of any software project. It defines how different components of the system interact with each other and ensures that the system is scalable, reliable, and maintainable. In the GameFace project, we utilized a microservices architecture to allow for independent deployment and scaling of different services.
       For a detailed understanding of the System Architecture, refer to the [System Architecture Diagram](../tech/diagrams/gameface-architecture.mmd). This diagram provides a visual representation of the system's structure and its components.
     - Data Flow Diagrams
       Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) are essential for visualizing how data moves through the system. They help identify potential bottlenecks and ensure that data is handled securely and efficiently. In our project, we created DFDs to map out user interactions and data processing workflows.
       For a detailed understanding of Data Flow Diagrams, refer to the [Data Flow Diagram](../tech/diagrams/data-flow.mmd). This diagram illustrates how data travels through various components of the GameFace system.
     - Component Design
       Component Design focuses on breaking down the system into manageable parts. Each component is designed to perform a specific function, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain. For GameFace, we designed components for user authentication, video streaming, and real-time communication.
       For a detailed understanding of the Component Design, refer to the [Component Design Diagram](../tech/diagrams/component.mmd). This diagram provides a visual representation of how the components interact and their respective responsibilities within the system.
     - Security Considerations
       Security is a critical aspect of Technical Design. We implemented various security measures, including encryption, secure authentication protocols, and regular security audits to protect user data and ensure compliance with industry standards.
       For a comprehensive overview of our security approach, refer to the [Security Design Document](../tech/diagrams/security.mmd). This document outlines the security measures in place and their implementation details.

  4. Highlight tools and methodologies used:
     - UML diagrams
     - Sequence diagrams
     - Activity diagrams
     - Design patterns
  5. Provide examples or visuals to illustrate the concepts (e.g., diagrams from the project).
  6. Conclude with a teaser for the next video on Visual Design.

- **Task List**:
  - Write the script.
  - Record the video.
  - Edit and publish the video.
